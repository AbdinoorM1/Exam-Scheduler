# Exam Scheduler

**Exam Scheduler** is an interactive Python program that lets users generate exam schedules based on provided CSV files for exam times and room availability. It uses recursive backtracking to ensure that exams are scheduled in rooms and prints a readable schedule for each room. The program also includes a tester function to quickly evaluate all exam and room files.

**Requires: Python 3**

## Quick Start:

### Using Git / Terminal
1. Open your terminal and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:AbdinoorM1/Exam-Scheduler.git
# or via HTTPS:
# git clone https://github.com/AbdinoorM1/Exam-Scheduler.git
```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
```
cd "Exam-Scheduler"
```
3. Run the program:

```

## Quick Testing:

For an easy and simple way to test all exam and room files at once, just run:
`python3 run_tester.py` in your terminal.
This will run the solver on all provided CSV files and print which schedules are possible, and those that aren't.

## Manual Download:

1. Download the repository from GitHub.
2. Ensure the .csv files are inside the `Exam Scheduler` project folder.
3. Run `Exam_Scheduler.py` with Python 3, or use `tester()` for quick testing.
